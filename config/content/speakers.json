The talk is not technical, but we will cover the impact of semantics on the division of technical stacks. Next, we will look at real-world misses and why the abdication of security creates issues and see how these misses cause deeper long-term problems. Finally, the listener will learn how we get back to a place where security operations and development work together in big companies. The listener will learn to recover from this split through some tools and practices, how tools should be used across roles and silos, and why communication with a new set of semantics would be a good idea."

The goal is to demonstrate a payload that would achieve a high execution rate in an organization. Throughout this talk, we will illustrate the methodology involved in creating and deploying a payload to target an organization.

You need a robust and comprehensive detection and response program to fight the modern day attackers that threaten to disable, disrupt, degrade, destroy, and steal from the enterprise you protect. But there\u2019s a lot of challenges: alert fatigue, budgets, hiring talent, and your current team is burned out.\r\n\r\nHow do you successfully build a modern detection and response program, all while riding the rocket of never ending incidents and unforgiving on-call schedules?\r\n\r\nThis talk boils down all that I\u2019ve learned in the last decade about building detection and response programs into 49 minutes.

Have you ever been traveling and needing to install a software package to do a quick action, but find out that your laptop's 128GB drive won't be enough? By using Kubernetes to host these tools we can reduce the time it takes to perform essential reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis tasks. We can also reduce the setup time to teach others about reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis by having easy to deploy containers that won't have dependency issues to battle. This presentation will cover the journey that includes many successes and failures experienced while implementing a Kubernetes cluster designed for Android package reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis work. This will include selecting hardware, network setups, software used, building containers, and an adhoc usability study to inform the potential benefits and downfalls of using this system."

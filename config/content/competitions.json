  "description": "Like card games? You do? What about learning about incident response while playing card games? Great! Join us for competitive Backdoors and Breaches where you can learn to play Backdoors & Breaches originally created at Black Hills Information Security. To play you get 10 turns to discover four pieces of the attack chain used by an attacker before it's too late! We will teach you how to play so you can try our competitive version where you will face off against another attendee as you try to discover the attack path being used at “your organization” before they do. It's learning, it's fun, it's meeting folks. So join us and learn how to play and win prizes!"
